## RFCs

A Request for Comments (RFC) is a formal document drafted by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) that describes the specifications for a particular technology. When an RFC is ratified, it becomes a formal standards document. We need to read from `RFC 7230` to `RFC 7235` to implement basic workings of HTTP.
